## Description

This is my third challenge in the UCSD web dev course. The purpose of this site is to apply what I have learned in this course so far. The focus of this project was to really focus in on javascrip. The features of the website are as follows: 
- When someone clicks on the button to generate password they are given a series of prompts for the password criteria
- When someone is prompted for the length they can choose between 8 and 128 characters
- When someone picks a number outside our limits they get a message about it
- People have the option to include lowercase, uppercase, numerics, and special characters in the password
- When the password is generated it is displayed on the page
## Installation

Open the link in my GitHub Repo!

## Usage
- First click on the generate password button

- You will be presented with a prompt to choose the length, in this case we chose 22

- Next you will be prompted to pick the characters you want

![alt text](./Assets/chars.png)
- Here we picked all of the options

You should be presented with a randomly generated password!
